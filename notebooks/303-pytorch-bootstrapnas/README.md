# Optimizing PyTorch models using BootstrapNAS with the Neural Network Compression Framework.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use [BootstrapNAS/NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf) to generate and train a weight-sharing super-network. Once the super-network has been trained, BootstrapNAS searches for a sub-network that improves over the original model in performance and efficiency.
